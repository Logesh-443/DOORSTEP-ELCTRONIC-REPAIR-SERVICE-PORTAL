# Doorstep Electronic Repair Service
# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to establish a web-based platform that provides on-site electronic repair services to customers in the comfort of their homes or offices. The service aims to simplify the process of getting electronic devices repaired by allowing users to schedule appointments for repairs without the hassle of transporting their devices to a service center.
